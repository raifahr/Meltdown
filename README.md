# Meltdown --- Kenney Game Jam 2025

[Link To Play](https://papadapolas.itch.io/melt-down)

Congratulations! You’ve landed a job at the suspiciously powerful and deeply ethical conglomerate LANDOWNER & INSURACORP LLC! Your new role? Weaponize climate change. Armed with solar tech and unquestionable ethics, your job is to melt glaciers and raise global sea levels. 
Why? By melting glaciers, you’ll submerge coastal cities - displacing millions, who will then gladly rent from your company’s ever-expanding housing empire. Even better? Rising sea levels aren’t covered by insurance, so L&I LLC cashes in twice. Every millimeter of sea rise is a payday - and a power move for the execs at the top. 

Take command of "The Enforcer" - a sleek, solar-powered ship equipped with a flamethrower (because nothing says “green energy” like open fire). Harness the raw power of the sun to race across the waves or incinerate anything in your way. But not everyone’s onboard. Furious eco-activists are coming for you in boats of their own, trying to ram yours and stop the madness. They want to save the planet. You want to own what’s left of it. Melt the ice. Sink the do-gooders. Make it home in time for your quarterly bonus. Rise to power. 

Features:
Solar power management: Spend energy on movement or flamethrowing,
High-stakes combat: Outspeed and outblast angry environmentalists in ship duels,
Glacier extermination: Raise the sea level one iceberg at a time,
Corporate comedy: A (not-so) subtle jab at unchecked capitalism and climate catastrophe,
